A project for TheOdinProject's HTML Foundations course.

 - In this project, I'm practicing the concept of "atomic commits" and writing concise commit messages.

 - I'm also getting the hang of using git from the command line.

 - The silly logo was an opportunity for me to learn how to paste and resize layered images in GIMP.

 - This was a good refresher on how to publish repositories to github pages.

 - This was a good refresher on the basics of styling web pages with CSS.
