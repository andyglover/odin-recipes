Recipes project for TheOdinProject

A project for TheOdinProject's HTML Foundations course.

 - One thing I am learning in this project is practicing the concept of "atomic commits" and writing concise commit messages.

 - This was a good refresher on how to publish repositories to github pages.

 - The silly logo was an opportunity for me to learn how to paste and resize layered images in GIMP.
